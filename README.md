# Design Decisions

* Responsive Design
  * Media queries were based off of the way the content appeared on screen
    * this minimizes the need to add media queries for every device size
* Font choice
  * defaulted to Scandia Regular
  * Sometimes, the design documents listed Scandia as the font but displayed Helvetica
  * If the design documents requested Scandia-Bold but that choice didn't flow well with the overall appearance, I chose to use Scandia-Regular and add font-weight
* Target Icon for the Hero image
  * I left his out because I could only find an icon with a brighter red that made the contrasted too much.
* In a production environment, all of these choices would be discussed with the designer in a collaborative fashion
